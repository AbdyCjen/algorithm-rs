/**
 * [2516] Take K of Each Character From Left and Right
 *
 * You are given a string s consisting of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' and a non-negative integer k. Each minute, you may take either the leftmost character of s, or the rightmost character of s.
 * Return the minimum number of minutes needed for you to take at least k of each character, or return -1 if it is not possible to take k of each character.
 *  
 * <strong class="example">Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "aabaaaacaabc", k = 2
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation:
 * Take three characters from the left of s. You now have two 'a' characters, and one 'b' character.
 * Take five characters from the right of s. You now have four 'a' characters, two 'b' characters, and two 'c' characters.
 * A total of 3 + 5 = 8 minutes is needed.
 * It can be proven that 8 is the minimum number of minutes needed.
 *
 * <strong class="example">Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "a", k = 1
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: It is not possible to take one 'b' or 'c' so return -1.
 *
 *  
 * Constraints:
 *
 *     1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 *     s consists of only the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
 *     0 <= k <= s.length
 *
